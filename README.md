With this code I god items from amazon( whith its permision of course) it will scroll through pages and it will work every 20 seconds. Everything that this code gets it writes into csv file by names 'product name', 'price', 'rating' if there is no 'product name', 'price' or 'rating' it will   send AtributeError 'product name' = N/A, 'price' = N/A or 'rating' = N/A. I thank you for reading this.
